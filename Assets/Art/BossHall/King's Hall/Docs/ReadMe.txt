King’s Hall Model Kit

Welcome to the King’s Hall Unity Kit. With this package, you will be able to create realistic medieval castle interiors, complete with torches, battlements, castle doors, shelves, amphora vases, tapestries, a throne and a banquet table.

All of our models are built on the Unity grid, and can be tiled to create large complexes.

To get the demo scene up and running, you will need to download the free HDR skies from ProAssets:

You will also need to install the first person controller from the standard assets folder.
